# The NEAX Platform project repository

This repo contains the source code for Nigeria Energy Access Explorer, a platform for exploring 

Nigeria's Energy data. 



I made this project to sharpen my client & server-side coding skills, particularly with Django and React, and to gain some experience with WebGIS development. I have tried to keep the code as clean, modular, and well-documented as possible, for myself, of course.



TODO: 

* a more detailed description of the project and what it does
* how to install and run the project
